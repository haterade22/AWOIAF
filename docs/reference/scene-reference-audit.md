# Scene Reference Audit

How to verify that every scene DOTS references actually exists on disk — and repoint the stale ones. Run this **after any Bannerlord version bump** and whenever editing `settlements.xml` or `sp_battle_scenes.xml`.

## Why

TaleWorlds renames and removes scenes between versions. DOTS references scenes in two places:

1. **`settlements.xml`** — each settlement's `<Location scene_name="X">` (town/village/castle/hideout scene + house/tavern/dungeon interiors).
2. **`sp_battle_scenes.xml`** — `<Scene id="X" map_indices="...">` maps campaign-map terrain cells to the battle-terrain scene used for **field battles**.

If `X` has no matching `SceneObj/X/` folder, the game **crashes** when that scene loads — entering the settlement/house, or fighting a field battle on a map cell mapped to the missing battle terrain. The crash surfaces far from the stale value, so it reads as "battles near a specific place crash" rather than "bad XML."

This is a data-reference bug, not an engine bug. **Check the references before suspecting engine internals.**

## The tools

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| [`tools/audit_scene_names.py`](../../tools/audit_scene_names.py) | Extracts every settlement `scene_name`/`scene_name_N` from the map module (`--module`, default `AWOIAF_Map`) and vanilla `SandBox`, cross-references vs the `SceneObj/` folders of the **enabled** modules only (`--enabled`, case-insensitive), diffs map vs vanilla. Exit 1 on crash suspects — a gate. |
| [`tools/audit_battle_scenes.py`](../../tools/audit_battle_scenes.py) | Compares DOTS's `sp_battle_scenes.xml` Scene ids vs vanilla + on-disk SceneObj; flags ids with no folder; checks 0–255 `map_indices` coverage (an uncovered index = no battle scene). |
| [`tools/remap_stale_scene_names.py`](../../tools/remap_stale_scene_names.py) | Verified `scene_name` remap (every replacement confirmed present in an enabled module before writing; `scene_name_1..3` included; byte-faithful atomic write; `--backup` optional). Edit its `REMAP` dict for new renames. |

```bash
python tools/audit_scene_names.py        # settlement scene refs -> full report
python tools/audit_battle_scenes.py      # field-battle terrain scenes -> crash suspects + coverage
python tools/remap_stale_scene_names.py --dry-run   # preview fixes; --apply --backup to commit
```

## Key gotchas

- **Case-insensitive.** Windows resolves `HART_ISENGARD` vs `HART_isengard`. An exact-case audit false-flags these; the tools lower-case both sides.
- **The map is external.** The loaded map is `<game>/Modules/AWOIAF_Map/ModuleData/settlements.xml` (Id `AWOIAF_Map`, seeded from the ADOD map — see [`../features/awoiaf-map.md`](../features/awoiaf-map.md)). The repo ships no settlements.xml; `DOTS_Map` and its repo shadow are retired.
- **Custom-scene typo vs vanilla fallback.** If a missing scene has a near-match in `AWOIAF_Map/SceneObj` (a real custom scene referenced with a typo, e.g. `corspe_lake` vs on-disk `adod_corpse_lake`), repoint to the real custom scene. Only fall back to a vanilla scene of the matching settlement type when no custom scene exists — and prefer porting the scene into the module (`tools/awoiaf_map/port_adod_scenes.py`) over a lossy remap.
- **Packed scenes.** Scenes can in principle be packed (`.tpac`) rather than `SceneObj/` folders; the folder check could false-negative. In practice DOTS/vanilla scenes are folders.
- **No duplicate Scene ids in `sp_battle_scenes.xml`.** Vanilla never reuses a `<Scene id>`. When repointing a broken battle terrain, use a real id NOT already in DOTS's file (don't duplicate an existing one).

## v1.4.5 findings (2026-05-28) — reference for the pattern

| Stale reference | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `<culture>_house_a_interior_house` (battania/khuzait/sturgia/vlandia) | v1.4.5 renamed house-interior scenes | repointed to `battania_town_house_b_interior_b_house`, `khuzait_house_c_interior_a_house`, `sturgia_town_house_d1_interior_b_house`, `vlandia_city_house_a_interior_house` (61 refs) |
| `battle_terrain_extended` (map cells 158–255) | DOTS-invented catch-all scene that never existed | repointed to `battle_terrain_r` (real Plain scene) |
| `lotraom_e_osgiliath_i_forceatmo` | typo — real scene is `lotrdots_e_osgiliath_i_forceatmo` | repointed to the real custom scene |
| `castle_orthanc_gate`, `castle_village_isengard_a`, `village_isengard_a` | custom Isengard scenes never built | repointed to rugged vanilla scenes (`battania_castle_a`, `battania_village_c`, `battania_village_e`); rebuild proper Isengard scenes later |

All 99 vanilla-derived hideout scenes were present (`bandit_forest_sv`, `desert_hideout_002/004_sv`, `hideout_steppe_001/002_sv`, `mountain_hideout_002/004_sv`, `sea_bandit_a-d_sv`). The 30 new `hideout_gondor/erebor/mirkwood_*` scenes are authored in the editor but not yet exported to `SceneObj/` — interim-repointed to vanilla hideout scenes so raids don't crash; revert each `scene_name` to its settlement id once the custom scenes are compiled to disk.
